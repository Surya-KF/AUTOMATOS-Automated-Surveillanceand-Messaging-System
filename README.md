# AUTOMATOS - Automated Surveillance and Messaging System

## Overview

AUTOMATOS is an automated surveillance and messaging system designed to enhance security and monitoring capabilities using video footage. This project leverages Python and YOLO models for processing CCTV footage to detect and identify individuals.

## Features

- **Automated Surveillance**: Monitors video feeds for specific activities and individuals.
- **Messaging System**: Sends notifications based on predefined criteria.
- **CCTV Integration**: Works with existing CCTV systems for seamless integration.
- **YOLO Models**: Utilizes YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models for detection accuracy.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Surya-KF/AUTOMATOS-Automated-Surveillanceand-Messaging-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AUTOMATOS-Automated-Surveillanceand-Messaging-System
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
